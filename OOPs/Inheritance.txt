Single Inheritance:
    *A class inherits from one parent class using the extends keyword. This is the most basic form of inheritance.

Multiple Inheritance:
    *A class can inherit from multiple parent classes.
    *However, TypeScript does not support multiple inheritance directly instead, TypeScript uses mixins to achieve this behavior.(Diamond problem)

Multilevel Inheritance:
    *A class is derived from another class, which is also derived from another class, forming a chain of inheritance.

Hierarchical Inheritance:
    *Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.

Hybrid Inheritance:
    *A combination of multiple types of inheritance.
    *Since TypeScript doesn't support multiple inheritance, mixins are used to simulate hybrid inheritance where needed.
