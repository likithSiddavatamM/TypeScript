Abstraction:

*Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
*It helps you define the structure of an application without revealing the implementation details, making the code easier to manage and scale.
*Abstraction in TypeScript is mainly achieved using interfaces and abstract classes.
