Encapsulation:

*It is the concept of wrapping data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class.
*The key idea is to restrict direct access to some of the object’s components and only expose what is necessary.
*This is achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public to control how data is accessed and modified.

Usage:

*Use private for critical data: Hide fields that shouldn’t be accessed or modified outside the class, like sensitive or critical information.
*Use protected carefully: Allow subclasses to access members that they may need to override or modify, but don’t expose them to other external classes.
*Provide methods for controlled access: Always use getters and setters for read/write access to private fields when necessary, and add validation or transformation logic as needed.
